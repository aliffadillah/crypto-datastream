# 🚀 Deployment Fix Summary

## ✅ Changes Made (October 4, 2025)

### Problem
Coolify deployment failed with error:
```
error: undefined variable 'nodejs-20_x'
```

### Root Cause
- Nixpacks configuration used incorrect package names (`nodejs-20_x`, `npm-10_x`)
- Nix package manager doesn't recognize these variable names

### Solution
**Switched from Nixpacks to Dockerfile** for more reliable and predictable builds.

---

## 📋 Files Created/Modified

### ✅ Created Files:
1. **`.node-version`** - Specifies Node.js 20.19.0
2. **`.dockerignore`** - Optimizes Docker build by excluding unnecessary files
3. **`.npmrc`** - NPM configuration with legacy-peer-deps
4. **`Dockerfile`** - Multi-stage Docker build (optimized)
5. **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment guide

### ✅ Modified Files:
1. **`package.json`** - Added engines requirement (Node >=20.19.0)
2. **`nuxt.config.ts`** - Added production optimizations
3. **`.gitignore`** - Updated to exclude build artifacts

### ✅ Deleted Files:
1. **`nixpacks.toml`** - Removed (caused the error)

---

## 🐳 Dockerfile Strategy

Using **multi-stage build** for optimization:

### Stage 1: Builder
- Node.js 20.19.0-alpine
- Install build dependencies (python3, make, g++)
- Install npm packages with `--legacy-peer-deps`
- Build Nuxt application

### Stage 2: Production
- Node.js 20.19.0-alpine (minimal)
- Copy only built `.output` directory
- No dev dependencies
- Smaller final image size

## 🔧 Deployment Steps in Coolify

### 1. Configure Build Method
In Coolify Dashboard:
1. Go to your app → **Settings**
2. **Build Pack** → Select **"Dockerfile"**
3. **Save**

### 2. Add Environment Variables
In Coolify Dashboard → **Environment Variables**:
```bash
NUXT_PUBLIC_CRYPTO_API_PROVIDER=binance
NUXT_PUBLIC_COINGECKO_API_KEY=
NUXT_PUBLIC_BINANCE_API_KEY=
NUXT_PUBLIC_BINANCE_API_SECRET=
NUXT_PUBLIC_CRYPTOCOMPARE_API_KEY=
```

### 3. Deploy
Click **"Deploy"** or wait for auto-deployment from GitHub push.

---

## ✅ Expected Build Process

```
1. Docker pulls node:20.19.0-alpine
2. Installs build dependencies
3. Copies package.json and .npmrc
4. Runs: npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
5. Copies application files
6. Runs: npm run build
7. Creates production image with .output
8. Starts server: node .output/server/index.mjs
9. Listens on port 3000
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Nixpacks with wrong package names | ✅ Dockerfile with correct Node version |
| ❌ Single-stage build | ✅ Multi-stage optimized build |
| ❌ No build dependency handling | ✅ Explicit build deps (python3, make, g++) |
| ❌ Unclear deployment process | ✅ Complete documentation |
| ❌ No .dockerignore | ✅ Optimized with .dockerignore |

---

## 🧪 Testing Locally

Test the Docker build locally before deploying:

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t crypto-datastream .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_CRYPTO_API_PROVIDER=binance \
  crypto-datastream

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 📊 Build Metrics

Expected build times:
- **First build**: 3-5 minutes (downloads dependencies)
- **Subsequent builds**: 1-2 minutes (cached layers)

Image size:
- **Builder stage**: ~300-400 MB
- **Final production image**: ~150-200 MB

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If build still fails:

1. **Clear Coolify build cache**
   - Settings → Build Cache → Clear

2. **Verify Dockerfile is detected**
   - Check build logs for "Dockerfile detected"
   - Ensure Dockerfile is in repository root

3. **Check environment variables**
   - Ensure all required vars are set in Coolify

4. **Monitor build logs**
   - Watch for specific errors
   - Check if Node.js 20.19.0 is being used

### Common Issues:

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Cannot find Dockerfile" | Ensure file is committed to repo root |
| "npm ERR! code EBADENGINE" | Dockerfile handles this (uses Node 20) |
| "oxc-parser binding error" | Build stage installs necessary deps |
| "Port already in use" | Coolify handles port mapping automatically |

## ✅ Success Indicators

After successful deployment, you should see:

1. ✅ Build completes without errors
2. ✅ "Server listening on port 3000" in logs
3. ✅ Application accessible at your Coolify domain
4. ✅ Crypto data loads from Binance API
5. ✅ No console errors in browser

## 📝 Commit History

```
commit 1412695
Fix deployment: Use Dockerfile instead of nixpacks, add .dockerignore

Changes:
- Deleted nixpacks.toml (incorrect package names)
- Updated Dockerfile (multi-stage build)
- Added .dockerignore (build optimization)
- Updated DEPLOYMENT.md (new instructions)
```

## 🎉 Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. [ ] Verify application is running
2. [ ] Test all features (table, chart, export)
3. [ ] Monitor API rate limits
4. [ ] Set up custom domain (optional)
5. [ ] Configure SSL (auto with Coolify)
6. [ ] Add monitoring/logging
